COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

1. PowerShell Commands:
   - DON'T use: ls -la (Linux command)
   - USE: dir or Get-ChildItem (PowerShell commands)
   - DON'T use: && (Linux operator)
   - USE: ; (PowerShell commands)

2. File Paths:
   - DON'T try to write to C:\ directly (permission denied)
   - USE: Current working directory or full path like C:\Users\globa\teacher-shopping-app\

3. File Operations:
   - DON'T assume files exist without checking
   - ALWAYS verify file exists before trying to read/modify

4. Tool Usage:
   - DON'T keep trying the same failing approach
   - READ the file first, then make targeted changes
   - USE MultiEdit for multiple changes to same file

5. Context:
   - DON'T lose track of current working directory
   - ALWAYS check pwd/Get-Location first
   - REMEMBER we're in C:\Users\globa\teacher-shopping-app
